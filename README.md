# M-Feedback

General Feedback:
Boss fight's that have timer based add mechanics add way more to the boss fight length. Should just keep them like ruby life pool first boss and do % health based phasing.

We are also hitting the survivability wall before the timer wall. Especially with the 40% change recently.

Ruby Life Pool
Ice shield from Chillweaver needs a initial cast before channel. Mobs get shielded instantly.
Frigid Shard is pure magic damage. Lot of tanks won't be able to survive this as comfortably as others. Should work like Jaina or last boss Necrotic Wake auto attacks.

Cinderweavers(especially the ones with 2) need adjustment. Double cinderweaver + inferno guy is impossible for most players.

Solutions:
1) Add a cooldown on cinderbolt like fishmancers in Gambit
2) Make it a lot less deadly. Longer cast/a lot lower dmg.
3) No more double cinderweavers in any specific pack. Just limit it to 1 per pack.

Flamegullet
Too much magic damage for certain tanks. Not the worst thing since it's skippable but might be too much
Shockcallers extremely overtuned but also skippable. They're like gatekeepers in necrotic wake

Blazehoof
Sometimes bolders explode on random doodads. Can be really random(things like benches, rocks etc.) don't know if fixable maybe just make it not blow up on walls?

High Channeler Ryvati: Shock blast cast is a little too quick(1 second) and if it goes off it will cast on a dps immediately into a thunder storm.
Thunderstorm might be too much dmg? Healing power is weird atm with the 40% change. Some healers will struggle hard, others are fine.


Stormvein
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1644409836?t=6h11m12s
Stormstrike frequency/damage way too high. Right now it does about 80-110% of tanks hp every 10 seconds. Also if flamespit goes on tank it can just combo for even more. Maybe flamespit never goes on tank and lower frequency so tanks have enough defensives to survive every stormstrike
Flamespit + interrupt overlap can happen making it almost impossible for healers to heal the insane damage incoming.
Maybe make flamespit only drop a single flame puddle under you or less puddles.
Boss is also insanely hard to move as a tank. First boss had similar issue but got fixed could be good if that was applied to this boss aswell.
Pushing dragon below 50% bugs out the fight. Cannot kill the boss after.

Algethar Academy
Skitterfly sting dmg(overtuned, 1 shotting players if combo'd)

Overgrown Ancient
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=2h50m34s
Barkbreaker overtuned(especially on tyranical vs non prot warrior tanks) does massive damage and the debuff is too much
Burst forth tyranical scaling + the bleed combo bit too much
The bleed dispel from the add healing the other adds is also kinda dumb. We need to dispel our bleed but also need to move the mobs out.
Lasher aggro out of control when they all pop up at once(especially healing threat). Also the poison does way too much dmg/stacks too fast and too high. Impossible to cleanse that often.

Bridge miniboss
https://www.twitch.tv/dorki/clip/ModernSparklyOstrichPJSugar-zzWj9KcRuGaQD3Yo
Way too often/high damage magic tank buster hit. Roughly 10 second cd and is pure magic dmg. Circle maybe too big? melee can line but might be counterintuitive to most players.

Bird boss
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=3h11m19s
Screech does not increase dmg each time it goes off(the debuff doesnt work). Dmg is overtuned though it is getting to 1 shot territory in tyrannical
Bleed might be too much for some tanks that don't handle bleed well.
Boss hit box maybe bigger? Hard for melees to hit and see fire swirlies. Swirlies either too fast or too many? Maybe too overwhelming with winds + tornados + fire. Reduce frequency of mechanics

Battle axe bleeds might be too much for some tanks that don't handle bleed well. Maybe make them stunnable/no recast. 
Arcane Rain swirly animation too light/feint hard to see.

Invoker's arcane missles don't do any damage/scale? Arcane bomb maybe cheesable? 


Halls of Valor
Hymdall
The tank bleed is now a fervant strike. It will target nearby melee if tank isn't in range.

Hyrja
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=0h45m1s
Sometimes boss spell ques shield of light first and will delay the mechanic making it deadlier.
The eye of storm+arcing bolt combo a bit too overtuned.

Fenryr
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=1h0m3s
Bleeds are fine for good players, but it gets extremely out of hand if no1 is dodging the bleeds.
Maybe bleeds shouldn't stack? or no stack beyond some stack.

Odyn
Runaway from circle mechanic bit too large. Spreads group too much and hard for some slow classes to move out

Azure Vault
General feedback
The dungeon run is long/lot of travelling

Crystal fury shard magic atk thing stacks up to infinite/maybe cap it or don't stack at all. 1 Debuff is already huge magic dmg + the initial hit

Unstable Curator
Forbidden knowledge very feint/hard to see. Especially the purple on purple

Crystal thrasher
Crystalline rupture maybe too big radius? Anti-melee

V Guard
Ice cutter is pure magic dmg. Bit too much for some tanks also it has high frequency/low cd. Once every 7 seconds?

Last 2 specific Drakonoid Breaker
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=11h29m50s
Beastial Roar syncs up and 1 shots on fortfied

Telash Greywing
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=11h31m24s
Spell queueing of Frost bombs + Icy devastator at same time is extremely deadly and hard to manage. The stack + spread/move manuever is rough, especially with melees. Happens once every other/third? Not sure

Umbrelskul
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=11h40m18s
Unleahsed destruction 1 shots/too much dmg even on fortified levels


Shadowmoon Burial Ground
General Thoughts
Reduce dungeon timer. It's a shortish dungeon

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=7h49m6s
R.R. Bone mobs void slash pure magic dmg, high frequency and very high damage. Rough for a lot of tanks.

Sadana Bloodfury
Might scale out of control with tyrannical + grievous. Lots of pulsing constant dmg

Enslaver's start casting rending voidlash when CC'd for the first time. It will target random players and do infinite magic damage. Also doesn't seem to have a cd? Casts after lockout ends. Also very rough on tanks weak to magic damage.

Nhallish
Void Blast you can reflect and it deletes the boss from existence. Kinda simple boss

Plagued bats
Does infinite disease magic damage. Stacks up to 5 times too. Can also be reflected for infinite damage.
Impossible to survive on fortified on some tanks without disease dispel. Maybe don't stack up to 5 times/only once? Frequency too high 5 second cd cast.

Bonemaw
Don't knoww hat is happening I just dodge and walk into the bones when it inhales. 

Void Spawns
Maybe cap stacks at 2? Idk or make it kickable again.

Nerzhul 
A lot of pulsing damage gets a bit out of control on tyranical grievous. 
Wall doesn't do anything.


Nokhud Offensive
General Feedback
Too much count required in this dungeon. Tight timer also with how much hp everything has(specifically last boss area)
Too mechanically dense/too many mobs to learn. The horn and let fly sound is a banger. 10/10 Great work

Centaur/First Boss Area
Multishot maybe needs indicator?
Hunt the prey 200% dmg increase + fixate makes it potentially hard for some to survive
Rally the clan recasting? Might be hard to deal with if it is constantly trying to buff the pack by 50%

Storm/2nd Boss area
The combination of squall blowing up + totemic overload + arcing strikes + storm bolt leads to random 1 shots/extremely high damage
maybe just remove the squall completely? serves no purpose with specific CCs just causes unnecessary class/comp/cc friction.
10 second cast frequency on totemic overload does like 80% of hp
10 second cast frequency on arcing blade
Side packs are ridiculously impossible with multiple stormbolt casts.

The raging tempest
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=4h26m50s
Really bad overlap of electrical storm + lightning strike doing 80% of hp into big raid damage
Purge is also too good. Maybe make it not purgable but a lot weaker? Currently 100% increase aspd + lots of magic dmg

Undead area?/Third boss
Way too many mechanics.
Death bolt volley is very frequent/no cooldown. That mob also has a bolstering mechanic that is permanent. Maybe stacks drop after some time? https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=4h35m18s
Desecrating Roar adds hard to pick up aggro instantly. They usually spawn and melee someone at least once before tank can get aggro.
Souls sometimes go through the ground especially on some terrain.
Chant of the dead is easily disruptable but if it ever does go off it is insane. 20 seconds of 50% DR + increase dmg is rough.

End Area
Mixture of too many bad/dangerous mobs. Lots of kicks(the thunderfist + the bloodcurdling scream) and arcblades

Last 2 minibosses are not worth fighting at all. They have 2-3x hp of every other mob and give little to no count(16 count each?)
The charge happens way too often and it charges really far making them impossible to cleave. Needs hp reduction.

Last boss has way too much hp. Feels like devos from spires will last an eternity on tyrannical. Charge maybe too far as well?


Temple of Jade Serpent
General feedback
Too long dungeon timer. Can be reduced by at least 5 minutes.

Tainted Ripple has a hidden 20% ms effect.
Double caster + tainted ripple similar to ruby life pool issue of too much kick coordination required. Maybe too dangerous.
Jiang and Xiang are heavily overtuned. Torch frequency too high(6 second cast frequency) + stacks. Not stacking/casting that often should fix them?
Haunted Sha casts pure magic damage too often(7 sec cast frequency and cant be stopped) and can be hard to deal with for some tank classes.
The Songbird queen stackable bleed sometimess can destroy tanks that don't deal with bleeds well.

Strife and peril
Very challenging on tyranical grievous. Also some mechanics just build stacks like fury of elune and maybe dancing runeweapon?

Mistweaver cast defiling mist too often(no cooldown just casts right out of lockout)/too quick of a cast
Sha-touched guardian has a fervant strike mechanic with the setting sunkick. Legsweep not recasting after being stopped would be good.
Minion of doubt high magic damage high frequency(10 seconds) and can't be stopped. Impossible for some tanks to survive on fortified. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=2h27m9s (300k magical dark claws, 271k haunting gaze)
Shattered Resolve swirlies are extremely feint and hard to see(greyish swirlies)
Door isn't opening after killing Liu. Runback is far too long.
Trash pack after Liu is very kick intensive(the 0 sec cd lockout defiling mist and waterspeaker)

Sha of doubt
If mechanic is working properly might be too much on tyranical + grievous. It's a long + cosntantly dmg boss healers will be starved on mana.

Court of Stars
Most dungeon RP can be strategical/used as a break mid dungeon but the beginning boat rp in this dungeon doesn't serve any purpose. People also have a cheese that's been used since legion to skip the RP by starting the lantern and putting in the key when the boat reaches a specific point to save almost a minute off the key timer.
