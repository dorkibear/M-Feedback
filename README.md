Easy to hard - Court of stars, Temple, Shadowmoon, Algethar, HoV, Ruby, Azure, Nokhud

# Ruby Life Pool
## General Tuning
Well tuned except for some parts. Right now beginning trash suffers quite a bit on sanguine and bolstering(mostly the juggernauts and ice shield).
Hardest parts are first boss on tyrannical, the destroyers on fortified and the lightning storm's on fortified.
*mostly well tuned, just healer balance is an issue*

## Chillweaver 
Ice shield needs a initial cast before channel. Mobs get shielded instantly.

## Primal Juggernaut 
excavating blast needs better visuals. This mob also needs adjustment(might be too hard to fight especially with affixes). Hard/clunky to move
*visuals are important*

## Terrasentry 
stone missle needs better visual.
*visuals are important*

## First boss
Frigid Shard is pure magic damage. Lot of tanks won't be able to survive this as comfortably as others. Should work like Jaina or last boss Necrotic Wake auto attacks.

## Flamegullet
Too much magic damage for certain tanks. Not the worst thing since it's skippable but might be too much

## Thunderhead 
thunderjaw needs a longer cast time for less experienced players to react with defensives.

## Blazehoof
Sometimes bolders explode on random doodads. Can be really random(things like benches, rocks etc.) don't know if fixable maybe just make it not blow up on walls?
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1651051974?t=0h56m39s it blows up on the road here insta killing 3 of us.
*this has been a huge issue in recent testing. lots of hard lost keys to random bolder deaths on the most obscure floors*
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1657825719?t=15h19m19s

## Last boss Stormvein
*A lot more managable now*
When Kyrakka lands at 50% there is no aggro table til it fully lands.
Fires can desync https://clips.twitch.tv/PolishedOddSwanHumbleLife-B8l2V0k-g74gdWyT

*dont know if fixed*


# Algethar Academy
## General Tuning
skitterflys are still overtuned and are always skipped on fort/high keys unless they get fixed. all of the count is gotten at the end and we skip as much as possible.

## Skitterfly 
sting dmg still(overtuned, 1 shotting players if combo'd). could add a cast to the sting for counterplay or make them not target same person.

## Hungry Lashers 
have on death affixes and it is really bad when they are way less hp/abundant. bursting main crimminal.

## Overgrown Ancient
Lasher aggro out of control when they all pop up at once(especially healing threat). Similar to Kyrakka aggro.
Also the poison does way too much dmg/stacks too fast and too high. Impossible to cleanse that often. Make it have an ICD on how fast you stack/cap it/nerf the dmg.
*this boss is mostly fine now but the poison is still way too much. DPS randomly get hit by them and tank will instantly build to 20+ stacks*

## Eagles
bolstering is really bad here.

## Bird boss
currently everyone is trying to avoid the 2nd goal cause of how unplayable it is to have winds + tornado + fire. might need to cut down on this a bit

## Scepter
Arcane Rain swirly animation too light/feint hard to see. Could use visual rework like the shattered resolve change in Temple.
*this needs help bad its basically invisible*

## Invoker
arcane missles don't do any damage/scale

# Halls of Valor
## General Tuning
Decently tuned. Most of the dungeons is fine now. Fenryr is rough unless everyone dodges the bleed.

## Shield Maiden
Hew frontal seems bigger/wider than normal frontals? Melee seems to die to this way more than any frontal I've seen so far. Sometimes melee seem to be getting hit from the side/behind aswell.
*dont know if this is still an issue*

## Hyrja
Eye of the storm with thundering is extremely hard to see(blue on blue). This is gamechanging cause if someone gets hit while theres massive group damage out(especially if healer gets hit) it can be game over.

## Fenryr
Bleeds are fine for good players, but it gets extremely out of hand if no1 is dodging/melding/vanish/invis the bleeds.
Maybe bleeds shouldn't stack or fall off like moroes bleed?
*this has been a notable issue especially on tyrannical when people play like normal*

## Skovald
Bit boring/bland fight. Maybe make ragnarok do damage(reduced) even with shield up would be interesting healing mechanic.
HUGE BUG: When boss dies while casting ragnarok, the shield will fade and kill people. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1657825719?t=11h30m46s

## Odyn
Rune dot is a bit nasty and hard to deal with when everyone is spread.

# Azure Vault
## General feedback
The 75% movespeed on runback is great. Can make it so we get that buff after every boss to improve traversing the dungeon.
Most of the dungeon is fine now just minor adjustments needed.

## Volatile saplings apply on death affix. Extremely bad for bolstering specifically.
*dont know if fixed or not*

## Crystal fury 
shard magic atk thing stacks up to infinite/maybe cap it or don't stack at all.
*1 attack is fine after nerf but when it stacks up it's too hard to survive. the whelps are the most notable problem when they spawn 3+ at once.*

## Unstable Curator
Forbidden knowledge very feint/hard to see. Especially the purple on purple. Needs the shattered resolve visual rework/improvement.
*really important these are basically invisble https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1658896766?t=4h8m53s*

## Azurewing
Very problematic fight that scales like crazy. Add spawns too randomly/far away and the cast is too fast. Also spawns way too frequently so we're constantly killing adds. Add phase also happens on timer, extending the boss fight by 30 sec~ everytime it happens. Also extremely dangerous with how much healing CD each phase requires(especially in our grievous tyrannical testing). Goes from being a fairly simple and forgiving fight to one of the harder fights.
*i'm not a healer but i still feel this fights too much compared to any other fight in the game atm. also scales out of control in higher tyrannical*

## Umbrelskul
The arcane orb+slow mechanic is extremely unfun and hard to deal with. Haven't done enough to comment but feels like they're impossible to outrun once they close in. Also makes it extremely hard to kill the crystals when the orbs are on them(as melee).
*after doing this fight more it is definitely a problem and sucks really bad. especially hard when the fight goes longer*

# Shadowmoon Burial Ground
## General Tuning
Reduce dungeon timer. It's a shortish dungeon.

## Mender
Can be mindcontrolled by priest and do half of bosses hp with their cast.
*dont know if fixed*

## Sadana Bloodfury
Add shouldn't be hard CC-able. Right now fight is solved by hard CCing the add and ignoring it. Should be slowed/stunable/soft cced.

## Bonemaw
This boss sucks it does nothing. Current strat is to ignore the adds and just hit the boss. Could just remove the adds and make the corpse breath dmg an actual healing mechanic.

# Nokhud Offensive
## General Feedback/Tuning
Too much count required in this dungeon. Tight timer because of all the count required. Overtuned compared to other dungeons.
All the mandatory mobs should net 70-80% count and let people pick the rest.
*This part still holds true. Need less mobs required in this dungeon. Right now we need to clear almost the entire dungeon while skipping 2nd and last boss trash. Also timers just lot tighter than other dungeons even though its a 40 minute long dungeon.*

## Centaur/First Boss Area
Multishot needs indicator. Noone ever knows they are getting shot by multishot.
Rest of the trash is properly tuned

Boss right now is chase adds the entire time. No uptime on boss with how often/high hp the adds are. Also scales out of control with keylevel/tyran.
Solutions:
1) Keep the adds and make ballistas do all the dmg for us
2) Nerf frequency of adds
3) Nerf the add hp
*after playing more of this, this boss is absolutely a problem that scales out of control*

## Storm/2nd Boss area
Remove/rework the squall mechanic completely. Serves no purpose with specific CCs just causes unnecessary class/comp/cc friction. Current strat is to just bring a warlock to banish the squall or have a hunter trap+dk grip it out. 
*this mechanic has been nerfed but its still very unpleasant to have and play around. should just remove the squall mechanic. The other mechanics are fine enough to have*

Primalist Thunderbeast way too dangerous and randomly runs at people(bug?)

## The raging tempest
Really bad overlap of electrical storm + lightning strike doing 80% of hp into big raid damage
Purge is also too good. Make it not purgable but a lot weaker. (the electric surge buff)
Sometimes you can't soak the orbs it's extremely buggy and gamebreaking.
This is one of the hardest fights right now for healers with how much healing is required. Especially hard on tyrannical grievous.
*still really hard with the overlap unless people know exactly how to deal with the overlap and not get 1 shot*

## Undead area?/Third boss
Way too many mechanics. The volleys alone require multiple kicks on top of the other casts in each pack.
Bolstering mechanic needs a rework/removed. Almost every key has struggled hard on this unless people intentionally single target the mob. This is especially bad on that one pack that has the birds fly over while you're fighting the pack. 

*after playing more, the bolstering mechanic is still by far the biggest pain point and is impossible to deal with unless people hard focus down the guy. once he bolsters and does shatter soul, its a 1 shot. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1658896766?t=3h2m37s* 

Guardian winds sometimes not kickable/bugged
https://clips.twitch.tv/StrangeInterestingBaboonEagleEye-nxY3UkXEjGq6p6EA
*still bugged*

HUGE BUG: Boss won't die and reset when one dies or something. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1658896766?t=3h15m14s

## End Area
Mixture of too many bad/dangerous mobs. Lots of kicks(the thunderfist + the bloodcurdling scream) and arcblades. Last pack before miniboss is basically unplayable.

Last 2 minibosses are not worth fighting at all. They have 2-3x hp of every other mob and give little to no count(16 count each?)
The charge happens way too often and it charges really far making them impossible to cleave. Needs hp reduction.
*still pretty bad and give no count*

The dispel mechanic heavily overtuned. A non dispelled strike does over 1 million damage. Tanks have no way of living if healer doesn't dispel in 1 second.
The spear suck in mechanic on a random player will double tick and 1 shot often.


# Temple of Jade Serpent
## General feedback/Tuning
Too long dungeon timer. Can be reduced by at least 5 minutes.

## First area
Boss bugs out sometimes and theres no telegraph on the beam. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1658896766?t=5h39m58s

## Second Area
Jiang and Xiang are still slightly overtuned, especially on fortified. Torch + charge still 1 shots.
Haunted Sha casts pure magic damage too often(7 sec cast frequency and cant be stopped) and can be hard to deal with for some tank classes.
Sha's explosion can't be stunned anymore making them really hard to deal with on high fortified. Especially dangerous when combined with mistweaver's touch of karma.

## Strife and peril
Extremely inconsistent. A lot of abilities give them stacks unintentionally. Galactic guardian procs, fury of elune, frozen orb, dancing rune weapon(?).
*still extremely inconsistent. some abilities generate stacks automatically*

## Third Area

Infester frontal needs better visual/indicator of frontal. Hard for range players to notice when there are a lot of adds around it. Maybe only aim at the tank?

Legsweep visual needs rework like Shattered resolve rework.

## Liu
Waves are still inconsistent and really hard to do without the line cheese strat.

## Sha of doubt
Too difficult for healers, especially on tyrannical grievous. Suffers from similar issue to kultharok in ToP where it either is very free or insanely hard(you bring a warlock and they dispel every debuff or dwarfs + spriest).
*just reduce the damage by a lot and make it not dispellable so it's not a free or too hard of a fight*

# Court of Stars
## General Feedback/Tuning
Still no point in the beginning RP.

Entire dungeon is too easy until the last boss. The difference is too big especially on tyrannical.

Quelling strikes are bad visually. Needs better visuals.

Mana wyrm on death explosion needs better visuals.
 
The current strat after first boss is someone runs ahead to start rp and die. Should just open up the doors and not have this cheesy strat that everyone needs to know.
 
Advisor Melandrus bit too hard on tyrannical especially without the RNG buffs.
