# M+Feedback

General Feedback:
Boss fight's that have timer based add mechanics add way more to the boss fight length. Should just keep them like ruby life pool first boss and do % health based phasing.

We are hitting the survivability wall before the timer wall. Especially with the 40% change recently. Suggestion: Lower the timer in keys to make them more about speed or tune dmg down.

Too many trash mobs require multiple kicks for 1 mob. In SL/BFA most mobs were stopped with 1 melee kick. Spammable casts would mostly only target tanks.

Dungeon Difficulty/Key level we've done
Easy - Court of stars(22), Temple(22), Shadowmoon(21), Algethar(21), Ruby(20), HoV(20 unless tyran), Azure(17? didn't do much), Nokhud(17 didn't do much/always wiped on tempest/3rd boss trash)

# Ruby Life Pool
## General Tuning
Well tuned except for some parts. Right now beginning trash suffers quite a bit on sanguine and bolstering(mostly the juggernauts and ice shield).
Hardest parts are first boss on tyrannical, the destroyers on fortified and the lightning storm's on fortified.

## Chillweaver 
Ice shield needs a initial cast before channel. Mobs get shielded instantly.

## Primal Juggernaut 
excavating blast needs better visuals. This mob also needs adjustment(might be too hard to fight especially with affixes). Hard/clunky to move

## Terrasentry 
stone missle needs better visual.

## First boss
Frigid Shard is pure magic damage. Lot of tanks won't be able to survive this as comfortably as others. Should work like Jaina or last boss Necrotic Wake auto attacks.

## Cinderweavers
(especially the ones with 2) need adjustment. Double cinderweaver + inferno guy is impossible for most players.
*The nerfs have made this a lot better. Could still use minor adjustments but ok for now*

## Flamegullet
Too much magic damage for certain tanks. Not the worst thing since it's skippable but might be too much

## Shockcallers 
extremely overtuned but also skippable. They're like gatekeepers in necrotic wake

## Destroyer 
living bomb frequency/dmg too high especially with DoT component. Almost 1 shots on 20~ fort every 17 seconds. Guarantee death if bolt goes off on this person targeted.

## Thunderhead 
rolling thunder 1 shots at a high level even with defensives. 21 fort was 1 shotting evoker with defensive.
thunderjaw needs a longer cast time for less experienced players to react with defensives.

## Blazehoof
Sometimes bolders explode on random doodads. Can be really random(things like benches, rocks etc.) don't know if fixable maybe just make it not blow up on walls?
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1651051974?t=0h56m39s it blows up on the road here insta killing 3 of us.

## High Channeler Ryvati: Shock blast cast is a little too quick(1 second) and if it goes off it will cast on a dps immediately into a thunder storm.
Thunderstorm overtuned/frequency way too high(every 20 seconds)
Too many thunderstorm mobs(3 total at the end area). Make them do thunderstorm at a certain % hp, or the 2 mobs weaker than the high channeler's thunderstorm. Right now each storm requires a really large healing cd + some defensive cds.

## Last boss Stormvein
*A lot more managable now*
When Kyrakka lands at 50% there is no aggro table til it fully lands.
Fires can desync https://clips.twitch.tv/PolishedOddSwanHumbleLife-B8l2V0k-g74gdWyT

# Algethar Academy
## General Tuning
Decently tuned. The hardest parts are getting through overgrown ancient(especially on tyrannical), not getting 1 shot by stingers on fort, surviving the bird and not dying to the surge/mana voids from the mana fiends. Play as little mana fiends as possible and fight the rest for count.

## Skitterfly 
sting dmg still(overtuned, 1 shotting players if combo'd)

## Hungry Lashers 
have on death affixes and it is really bad when they are way less hp/abundant. bolstering and bursting are the main criminals.

## Overgrown Ancient
Burst forth tyranical scaling + the bleed combo bit too much. Can delay burst forth cast so theres a chance to clear bleed before burst forth happens.
The bleed dispel from the add healing the other adds is also kinda dumb. We need to dispel our bleed but also need to move the mobs out.
Lasher aggro out of control when they all pop up at once(especially healing threat). Similar to Kyrakka aggro.
Also the poison does way too much dmg/stacks too fast and too high. Impossible to cleanse that often. Make it have an ICD on how fast you stack/cap it/nerf the dmg.

## Bridge miniboss
Still magic strikes too often(10 sec) making it hard to deal with on high fort for lot of tank specs.

## Bird boss
This boss is a hard DPS check intended? Only 1 set of each goal to clear the debuff. Could be insanely hard on high tyrannical without clears.
Tornado visuals could use some work.

## Battle axe 
bleeds might be too much for some tanks that don't handle bleed well. Maybe make them stunnable/no recast. 
Arcane Rain swirly animation too light/feint hard to see. Could use visual rework like the shattered resolve change in Temple.

## Invoker
arcane missles don't do any damage/scale? Arcane bomb maybe cheesable? 

## Last boss combination 1 shots bomb+missle
Might be worth checking numbers still especially on tyrannical

# Halls of Valor
## General Tuning
Decently tuned. Most things are fair until you get to hyrja. Biggest wall of the dungeon by far. Fenryr is rough unless everyone dodges the bleed.
All the packs with casters are really bad to fight atm. 3 count per mob and heavily limited in how many mobs you can fight at once.

## Hymdall
The tank bleed is now a fervant strike. It will target nearby melee if tank isn't in range. *not sure if fixed*

## Combination of Thundercallers/Mystic/Runecarver/Purifier
Cast too dangerous on fort especially when paired with thunderstrike
Mystic requires 3 melee kicks to cover every cast(10 sec holy radiance, 19 sec rune)
Runecarver is perfect for 1 melee kick(17 sec etch)
Purifier requires 3 melee kicks(7 sec cleansing flame)

## Shield Maiden
Hew frontal seems bigger/wider than normal frontals? Melee seems to die to this way more than any frontal I've seen so far. Sometimes melee seem to be getting hit from the side/behind aswell.

## Hyrja
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=0h45m1s
Sometimes boss spell ques shield of light first and will delay the mechanic making it deadlier. *not sure if fixed*
The eye of storm+arcing bolt combo a bit too overtuned. Maybe less arcing bolt frequency? Rely on healing the eye of storms.
Right now it's a better strat to play on sanctify side longer.

## Fenryr
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=1h0m3s
Bleeds are fine for good players, but it gets extremely out of hand if no1 is dodging/melding/vanish/invis the bleeds.
Maybe bleeds shouldn't stack or fall off like moroes bleed?

## 4 Kings
The brew tech to pull multiple kings is janky. 
Let players choose how many kings they can talk to and allow people to choose how many kings they wanna fight at once.
Better groups can play multiple kings at once and lust, others can do 1 at a time if they want.

## Skovald
Bit boring/bland fight. Maybe make ragnarok do damage(reduced) even with shield up would be interesting healing mechanic.

## Odyn
Runaway from circle mechanic bit too large. Spreads group too much and hard for some slow classes to move out

# Azure Vault
## General feedback
Bosses are bit overtuned compared to other dungeons. Rest is mostly well tuned.
The dungeon run is long/lot of travelling. The 75% movespeed on runback is great. Can make it so we get that buff after every boss to improve traversing the dungeon.

## Volatile saplings apply on death affix. Extremely bad for bolstering specifically.

## Crystal fury 
shard magic atk thing stacks up to infinite/maybe cap it or don't stack at all. 1 Debuff is already huge magic dmg + the initial hit 
*still too dangerous to take, does like 90% of tanks HP per hit. has counterplay for high level players but extremely punishing if no1 stops it*

## Unstable Curator
Forbidden knowledge very feint/hard to see. Especially the purple on purple. Needs the shattered resolve visual rework/improvement.

## Crystal thrasher
Crystalline rupture maybe too big radius? Anti-melee

## V Guard
Ice cutter is pure magic dmg. Bit too much for some tanks also it has high frequency/low cd. Once every 7 seconds?
*damage lowered but might still be a bit too frequent*

## Azurewing
Very problematic fight that scales like crazy. Add spawns too randomly/far away and the cast is too fast. Also spawns way too frequently so we're constantly killing adds. Add phase also happens on timer, extending the boss fight by 30 sec~ everytime it happens. Also extremely dangerous with how much healing CD each phase requires(especially in our grievous tyrannical testing). Goes from being a fairly simple and forgiving fight to one of the harder fights.

## Telash Greywing
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=11h31m24s
Spell queueing of Frost bombs + Icy devastator at same time is extremely deadly and hard to manage. The stack + spread/move manuever is rough, especially with melees. The puddles from frost bomb need some grace period before it does damage. Absolute zero slightly overtuned getting to 1 shot territory especially on tyrannical.

## Umbrelskul
The arcane orb+slow mechanic is extremely unfun and hard to deal with. Haven't done enough to comment but feels like they're impossible to outrun once they close in. Also makes it extremely hard to kill the crystals when the orbs are on them(as melee).

# Shadowmoon Burial Ground
## General Tuning
Reduce dungeon timer. It's a shortish dungeon. Entire key right now is getting by the extremely dangerous caster mobs and rest is free.

## R.R. Bone
Void slash still too much magic damage. (250k~ hit on my VDH with magic mitigation on 21 fort)

## Mender
Can be mindcontrolled by priest and do half of bosses hp with their cast.

## Sadana Bloodfury
Add shouldn't be hard CC-able. Right now fight is solved by hard CCing the add and ignoring it. Should be slowed/stunable/soft cced.

## Enslaver's 
start casting rending voidlash when CC'd for the first time. It will target random players and do infinite magic damage. Cast frequency way too high.
Right now strategy is to let domination cast because of how overtuned this mob is.

## Exhumers/spirits
Can be easily ninja pulled

## Nhallish
Kinda simple boss. The vortex doesnt do much damage. Could use more mechanics?

## Plagued bats
Does insane disease magic damage. Way too high cast frequency(5 sec) and recasts on cc. Absolutely destroys everyone on fortified unless perfectly controlled.

## Bonemaw
This boss sucks it does nothing. Current strat is to ignore the adds and just hit the boss. Could just remove the adds and make the corpse breath dmg an actual healing mechanic.

## Nerzhul
Good fight


# Nokhud Offensive
## General Feedback/Tuning
Too much count required in this dungeon. Tight timer because of all the count required. Overtuned compared to other dungeons.
All the mandatory mobs should net 70-80% count and let people pick the rest.
Too mechanically dense/too many mobs to learn. Everyone's been complaining about how every single pack has a ton of abilities.
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1650553673?t=1h48m11s Naowh's pov

The horn and let fly sound is a banger. 10/10 Great work

Right now the biggest wall is 2nd boss area and 3rd boss area. 
Current strat is fight as much trash in first boss area as possible, play the 2nd boss area as safe as possible, lust and somehow beat raging tempest, then do the 3rd boss area without bolstering the main deathbolt volley mob.

## Centaur/First Boss Area
Multishot needs indicator. Noone ever knows they are getting shot by multishot.
Rest of the trash is properly tuned
Boss right now is chase adds the entire time. No uptime on boss with how often/high hp the adds are. Also scales out of control with keylevel/tyran.
Solutions:
1) Keep the adds and make ballistas do all the dmg for us
2) Nerf frequency of adds
3) Nerf the add hp

## Storm/2nd Boss area
The combination of squall blowing up + totemic overload + arcing strikes + storm bolt leads to random 1 shots/extremely high damage
*still overtuned*

Remove/rework the squall mechanic completely. Serves no purpose with specific CCs just causes unnecessary class/comp/cc friction. Current strat is to just bring a warlock to banish the squall or have a hunter trap+dk grip it out. Otherwise you just eat 150-200k groupwide dmg for no reason while arcing strikes/bolts/totemic happens.

10 second cast frequency on totemic overload does like 80% of hp *not sure if changed*
Side packs are ridiculously impossible with multiple stormbolt casts.

Arcing blade does too much pure magic tank damage. Could use nerf on actual hit and up the cleave back to 50%.

Primalist Thunderbeast way too dangerous and randomly runs at people(bug?)

## The raging tempest
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1646276961?t=4h26m50s
Really bad overlap of electrical storm + lightning strike doing 80% of hp into big raid damage
Purge is also too good. Make it not purgable but a lot weaker. (the electric surge buff)
Sometimes you can't soak the orbs it's extremely buggy and gamebreaking.
This is one of the hardest fights right now for healers with how much healing is required. Especially hard on tyrannical grievous.

## Undead area?/Third boss
Way too many mechanics. The volleys alone require multiple kicks on top of the other casts in each pack.
Death bolt volley is very frequent. That mob also has a bolstering mechanic that is permanent. Maybe stacks drop after some time? 
*bolstering mechanic is no longer permanent but is still basically impossible once it's bolstered*
Bolstering mechanic needs a rework/removed. Almost every key has struggled hard on this unless people intentionally single target the mob. This is especially bad on that one pack that has the birds fly over while you're fighting the pack.

Desecrating Roar adds hard to pick up aggro instantly. They usually spawn and melee someone at least once before tank can get aggro.

Souls sometimes go through the ground especially on some terrain. *not sure if fixed*

Chant of the dead is easily disruptable but if it ever does go off it is insane. 20 seconds of 50% DR + increase dmg is rough.

Grasp of the dead is dangerous if it ever goes off.

Guardian winds sometimes not kickable/bugged
https://clips.twitch.tv/StrangeInterestingBaboonEagleEye-nxY3UkXEjGq6p6EA

## End Area
Mixture of too many bad/dangerous mobs. Lots of kicks(the thunderfist + the bloodcurdling scream) and arcblades. Last pack before miniboss is basically unplayable.

Last 2 minibosses are not worth fighting at all. They have 2-3x hp of every other mob and give little to no count(16 count each?)
The charge happens way too often and it charges really far making them impossible to cleave. Needs hp reduction.
*still pretty bad and give no count*

Last boss has way too much hp. Feels like devos from spires will last an eternity on tyrannical. *hp lot more normal now*
The dispel mechanic heavily overtuned. A non dispelled strike does over 1 million damage. Tanks have no way of living if healer doesn't dispel in 1 second.


# Temple of Jade Serpent
## General feedback/Tuning
Too long dungeon timer. Can be reduced by at least 5 minutes.
Decent difficulty all around. Dungeon right now is get to Liu and play a blood dk. The dangerous parts are all the heavy tank damage(everything does insane magic or bleed dmg) and the 2 bad bosses(strife and liu).

## First area
Double caster + tainted ripple similar to ruby life pool issue of too much kick coordination required. Maybe too dangerous on fortified.

## Second Area
Jiang and Xiang are still slightly overtuned, especially on fortified. Torch + charge still 1 shots.
Haunted Sha casts pure magic damage too often(7 sec cast frequency and cant be stopped) and can be hard to deal with for some tank classes. Also fervant strikes nearby melee when tank isn't in range.
The Songbird queen stackable bleed sometimess can destroy tanks that don't deal with bleeds well.
Sha's that explode on death are affected by raging making them do insane on death damage.
Golden Barrier might be too much damage/1 shot territory on high fort.

## Strife and peril
Extremely inconsistent. A lot of abilities give them stacks unintentionally. Galactic guardian procs, fury of elune, frozen orb, dancing rune weapon(?).
No idea what gives stacks and what doesn't. Also extremely confusing, especially the buff passing. Tanks can't keep up with their mitigation/self healing when they have to lay off the boss. Agony does insane magic damage even at lower stacks on tyrannical. Probably the worst "boss" fight so far.

## Third Area
Trees/camera is extremely bad in this area. Don't know if theres a fix but everyone has complained about this so far.
Mistweaver cast defiling mist too often(no cooldown just casts right out of lockout)/too quick of a cast *now has 8 sec cd but casts too quick*
Sha-touched guardian has a fervant strike mechanic with the setting sunkick. Legsweep not recasting after being stopped would be good. Legsweep visual also needs rework like Shattered resolve rework.
Minion of doubt high magic damage high frequency(10 seconds) and can't be stopped. Impossible for some tanks to survive on fortified. Also fervants nearby melee. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1645368560?t=2h27m9s (300k magical dark claws, 271k haunting gaze)
Shattered Resolve swirlies are extremely feint and hard to see(greyish swirlies) *fixed and way better now, can do same rework for a lot of visuals!*

## Liu
The most impossible boss in beta atm. Only tank that can do this boss is bdk and prot paladin to an extent. Or would require a healer that can do insane amount of ST healing.
The kicks happen WAY too often. Each kick requires a major defensive CD but it happens every 10 seconds. Damage also highly overtuned. Healing absorb from Jade serpent kick is insane and impossible for almost every tank. The waves are inconsistent and there is no way to react to them as a melee moving out.
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1652209959?t=6h11m11s I do not move at all and the waves have a lot of variance in how they form. Right now the melees cheese this mechanic by lining the circle instead of moving out.

## Sha of doubt
Too difficult for healers, especially on tyrannical grievous. Suffers from similar issue to kultharok in ToP where it either is very free or insanely hard(you bring a warlock and they dispel every debuff or dwarfs + spriest).
Boss length longer than most fights making it especially hard now that healers actually use mana.

# Court of Stars
## General Feedback/Tuning
Most dungeon RP can be strategical/used as a break mid dungeon but the beginning boat rp in this dungeon doesn't serve any purpose. People also have a cheese that's been used since legion to skip the RP by starting the lantern and putting in the key when the boat reaches a specific point to save almost a minute off the key timer.

Easy tuning. The whole dungeon is just going through the dungeon until you reach the miniboss on fortified or the last 2 bosses on tyrannical. You either get 1 shot/can't live or you time the key. Everything else doesn't do much(just dodge all the tank frontals and spam aoe CCs).

HP/Starlight brew/DR buff are too powerful compared to the rest. It makes a huge difference in surviving the last 2 bosses and the minibosses on fortified.
 
Arcane Manifestation is overtuned? NO idea what it does and noone ever fights it.

Quelling strikes are bad visually. Needs better visuals.

Mana wyrm on death explosion needs better visuals.
 
The current strat after first boss is someone runs ahead to start rp and die. Should just open up the doors and not have this cheesy strat that everyone needs to know.
 
Mistress Shadow slash does a bit too much tank magic damage.
Baalgar impending doom is too much damage on fortified without the RNG buffs that increase survivability.
Imaculyta scream of pain does too much damage on fortified without the RNG buffs that increase survivability.
 
Advisor Melandrus bit too hard on tyrannical especially without the RNG buffs.
